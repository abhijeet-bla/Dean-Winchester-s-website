                <td> Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) grew up hunting such terrifying things. But that's all in the past. Law school beckons him. So do safety and normalcy. That is, until Sam's older brother Dean (Jensen Ackles) appears with troubling news: their father, a man who's been hunting evil for 22 years, has disappeared. So now, to find him, the brothers must hunt what their father hunts... and Sam must return to the life he thought he'd left behind.</td>
